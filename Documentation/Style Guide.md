# Style Guide

# Image Sizes
* Unless otherwise noted, images should be a maximum of 1000px wide.  They should be saved in the smallest format possible (usually this is a .webp extension).  
* For images that are in Image Rotators, they should be wide not narrow.  In other words the picture was taken with a phone horizontally instead of vertically.  
* The Hero Image on the National Home Page is 2000x1333
* The top four rotators on the National Home Page can be any size since it is a collage.  The images should be a maximum of 1000px wide to decrease the image size and the associated loading time.
