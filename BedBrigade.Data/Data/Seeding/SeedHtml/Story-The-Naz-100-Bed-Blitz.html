    The Naz Church Missions showed that their faith was alive today by serving people in need in central Ohio with a 100 Bed Blitz with Bed Brigade. Pastor John Keating asked for 80 volunteers and the local body of Christ exceeded expectations. All glory and honor and praise to God our father forevermore.
