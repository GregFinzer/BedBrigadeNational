    Thanks to Aliah Keller of Spectrum News 1 for the interview and coverage of Bed Brigade.  It is our hope that more people would know that God sees the situation that they are in, that God knows them, and God loves them.  It is also our hope that more volunteers would delight in serving the Lord with us.  * Correction: Greg Finzer has been involved with Bed Brigade since 2020, not since 2012.
