    Bed Brigade would like to announce that we have a new President for the Grove City Chapter of Bed Brigade. Greg Finzer has been serving consistently on Bed Brigade for 4 years building and delivering beds for people in need in the Columbus, Ohio area. Greg had been praying that God would allow him to use his software engineering skills for the Lord. He built our website in 2022. Greg's desire is that God would be glorified by the expansion of Bed Brigade to a national level. That people all over the nation would know that God knows them, God sees them, and God loves them. His short term plan is to increase deliveries to serve people in need. God is at work in Bed Brigade. We are thankful for all our partners and friends who are serving the Lord on Bed Brigade.
