                We Build and Deliver Beds for people who need them. 
                There are people all over our city who are
                sleeping on the floor, on broken air mattresses, on a couch, or
                sharing a bed with siblings or parents.
              </p>
              <p>
                We want to give them each their own personal, safe place to
                sleep. But, more than wood, more than just a mattress, we want
                to come alongside families and let them know that God sees them
                and cares for them, and so do we. You can make a difference by
                partnering with us. We want to use our talents and resources to
                follow Jesus, to serve God and our community, and to see God's
                Kingdom come.<br />
              </p>
              <p>
                Many volunteers who come are amazed at how simple it is to Build
                a Bed and lift someone off the ground. We have thought this bed
                building process through, and volunteers with a desire to serve
                can successfully Build a Bed even if they've never previously
                used a cordless drill!<br />
              </p>
              <p>
                It
                takes about 2 1/2 hours to Build 40 Beds. Click the Volunteer link to sign up to help Build Beds.
                You can help assemble legs, attach them to side rails, attach
                hinge plates to side rails, headboards and footboards, help
                inspect and assemble Beds, and/or decorate footboards. You can
                sign up by clicking on the “Volunteer” button.<br />
              </p>
              <p>
                You can also help by Volunteering to help with Bed Delivery. It takes about
                2 1/2 hours to gather materials, pray, Deliver and Assemble
                Beds. Besides giving the dignity of a Bed, you will make a
                lasting impact for Jesus!<br />
              </p>
              <p>
                If you have a Delivery vehicle, that is super helpful. A
                mini-van with the middle seats removed and a back seat that
                folds down is ideal to Deliver 4-5 Beds. Larger SUVs also work
                very well (Suburban, Expedition, Escalade, Navigator, etc). A
                full size pickup with tie down straps or a Cap can carry 4-5
                Beds. Click the Volunteer link to sign up to help Deliver Beds<br />
              </p>
              <p>
                You can also help by donating. We always have a use for Beginner
                Bibles and pre-reader Bibles. Youth groups, Churches and
                families have hosted Bedding drives (Twin XL sheet sets), pillow
                drives, Bibles drives, and blanket-tying parties. Youth groups,
                athletic teams and home Bible studies have decorated
                footboards.<br />
              </p>
              <p>
                We always appreciate cash donations to help purchase lumber to
                Build Beds, and to purchase bedding. There are no paid staff at
                Bed Brigade. We are all volunteers. Please let us know
                how you would like to get involved.
