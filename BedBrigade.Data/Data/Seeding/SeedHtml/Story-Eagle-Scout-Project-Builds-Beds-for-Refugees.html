    On November 12th, 2022, twenty Bexley middle school and high school students and parents joined forces with Bed Brigade to build 40 beds. John Laing, one of Dean Hooverâ€™s former second grade students (now a high school senior) led the event as part of his BSA Eagle Scout project which will deliver the beds to refugee families being resettled in Columbus collaborating with US Together and Community Refugee and Immigration Services (CRIS).
