    The Women's Bible Study Group from LifePoint church plus John, Don, Tom, Mark, and Ron built 50 bed frames today in 2 hours! They not only served people in need in Columbus by building bed frames, they donated bedding and Children's bibles as well. Outstanding service for our Lord Jesus Christ! One woman even brought a drill in her purse!
