    Kappa Sigma Fraternity hosted a bed build at Capital University in partnership with Peace Lutheran and Upper Arlington Lutheran Church. These young men have put community service high on their membership commitment. They have been to be very active with Bed Brigade activities this year. There were fourteen beds built on Saturday. There were deliveries to two families, with nine beds after the build. This great bunch of young men have also been very active with Joseph Coats, Berwick K-8 mentorship and other civic activities. Hats off to their enthusiastic efforts.
