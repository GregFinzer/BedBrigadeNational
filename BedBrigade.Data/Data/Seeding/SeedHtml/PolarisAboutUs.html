        <span class="polaris-big-letter">A</span> t Bed Brigade, we strive to provide every child their own personal,
        safe place to sleep. Bed Brigade, we strive to provide every child their
        own personal, safe place to sleep. But, more than wood, more than just a
        mattress, we want to come alongside families and let them know that God
        sees them and cares for them, and so do we. You can make a difference in
        each child's life by <a href="/polaris/Donations">Donating</a> or <a href="/polaris/volunteer">Volunteering</a> with Bed Brigade. We want
        to use our talents and resources to follow Jesus, to serve God and our
        community, and to see God's Kingdom come in Columbus, Ohio.

        We Build and Deliver Beds for people who need them, all over the North
        Columbus and Delaware area. Bed Brigade began in Grove City, Ohio with a
        Church camp experience for teenagers (see <a href="/polaris/History">History</a>). Today, there are
        people all over the Columbus area who are sleeping on the floor, on
        broken air mattresses, on a couch, or sharing a bed with siblings or
        parents. Some research indicates that between 3 - 5% of children in the
        US don't have a bed of their own to sleep on.

        Many volunteers who come are amazed at how simple it is to build a bed
        and lift someone off the ground. We have thought the bed building
        process through and made it easy for volunteers of all skill levels. If
        a volunteer has the desire to serve, they can successfully build a bed
        even if they've never used a cordless drill!
      </p>

      <p>
        We build beds on the first Saturdays of each month. It takes about 2 1/2
        hours to Build 40 Beds. What a great way to spend a Saturday morning.
        You can help assemble legs, attach them to side rails, attach hinge
        plates to side rails, headboards and footboards, help inspect and
        assemble Beds, and/or decorate footboards. You can get more information
        on our <a href="/polaris/volunteer">Volunteer</a> page.
      </p>

      <p>
        If building isn't your thing, you can also help deliver beds. This is
        how you really get to show the Love of Christ, by delivering a bed to a
        child or family in need. We deliver beds on the second Saturday of the
        month. It takes about 2 1/2 hours to gather materials, pray, deliver and
        assemble beds. Besides giving the dignity of a bed, you will make a
        lasting impact for Jesus!

        If you have a delivery vehicle, that is super helpful. A mini-van with
        the middle seats removed and a back seat that folds down is ideal to
        deliver 4-5 Beds. Larger SUVs also work very well (Suburban, Expedition,
        Escalade, Navigator, etc). A pickup with a Cap can carry 4-5 Beds.
