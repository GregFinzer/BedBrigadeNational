    I lead Bed Brigade in Grove City. We build and deliver beds for families in need throughout central Ohio. It's very rewarding. On Friday my friend Dale and I picked up this 2020 Community Leadership Award from Franklin County Children's Services. Thank you for the recognition. We love helping people and we love getting them up off the floor and into their own personal safe place to sleep.
