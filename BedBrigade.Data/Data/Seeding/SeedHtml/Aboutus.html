                                    Bed Brigade is a faith-based nonprofit dedicated to building and delivering beds to those in need. We want you to know that God sees your circumstances, knows who you are, and loves you deeply.
                                </p>
                            </div>

                                    We have seen children sleeping on the bare floor, children sleeping on laundry, children sleeping on broken air mattresses, children sleeping on flattened boxes, and entire families sleeping in a single bed. The heart of The Bed Brigade is this; that every child would have a safe place to sleep, that every child would know that God loves them, and every child would have the Word of God. We bring children up off the floor and give them rest.
                                </p>

                                    Most of our beds (80%) go to children that do not have a bed. The remaining 20% are typically single mothers. If you are a single mother and feel like everyone has abandoned you, we are here for you. We would love to give you a bed.
                                </p>

                                    If you are reading this and are not in need of a bed, we would love for you to come and serve with us. Whether you are young, middle aged, or elderly, anyone can serve on Bed Brigade. <a href="/volunteer">Sign up today</a> to Volunteer to deliver or build. If there is not a bed brigade in your area, God might be calling you to start a chapter.
