ZXQUTzuiODLsgloonLp1RpfenR0gItaoVbVaFDrzNQK6H8eLPG0RpbRqe0ZQtRURb0NMyJcsSBPyBxxZ2znlaA==: We have seen children sleeping on the bare floor, children sleeping on laundry, children sleeping on broken air mattresses, children sleeping on flattened boxes, and entire families sleeping in a single bed. The heart of The Bed Brigade is this; that every child would have a safe place to sleep, that every child would know that God loves them, and every child would have the Word of God. We bring children up off the floor and give them rest.

If you are a single mother and feel like everyone has abandoned you, we are here for you. We would love to give you a bed.

Bed Brigade Columbus began in Grove City, Ohio with a Church camp experience for teenagers (see History). Today, there are people all over the Columbus area who are sleeping on the floor, on broken air mattresses, on a couch, or sharing a bed with siblings or parents.
I047wWX7C7o/X1ms/JaXGyeOLujID2X67M1xUwPNekG/uSPBKX9HJXjaVIqENiKTtzTylgZS7kDVIZX0UOqSBQ==: We want to give them each their own personal, safe place to sleep. But, more than wood, more than just a mattress, we want to come alongside families and let them know that God sees them and cares for them, and so do we. You can make a difference by partnering with us. We want to use our talents and resources to follow Jesus, to serve God and our community, and to see God’s Kingdom come in Columbus, Ohio.
ZvZ6GHkHFqTLso2//IrHwBfW6zEE65UswajSIGhmZgpvxlcyxRAk7kGd/LTeBPosssVAd+Y+6vWbStlltCe/UA==: Many volunteers who come are amazed at how simple it is to Build a Bed and lift someone off the ground. We have thought this bed building process through, and volunteers with a desire to serve can successfully Build a Bed even if they’ve never previously used a cordless drill!
6vQ5Qb8gE3QmmJS2eFmiImp0QKJsU9OSoMjY05ov+Yqv2E76E/DiRtVfkvBDvzIpJgUToDa6CwfsQQxa0x+Jeg==: We Build Beds on the first or second Saturdays of each month. It takes about 2 1/2 hours to Build 40 Beds on a Saturday morning. You can help assemble legs, attach them to side rails, attach hinge plates to side rails, headboards and footboards, help inspect and assemble Beds, and/or decorate footboards. You can sign up by clicking on the “Volunteer” button.

We Deliver Beds on almost all non-holiday Saturdays. It takes about 2 1/2 hours to gather materials, pray, Deliver and Assemble Beds. Besides giving the dignity of a Bed, you will make a lasting impact for Jesus!
L2Q0E+5bI+Prfy0rw1va+rCczuLay9p6QOEmJ00iTimHgJXdUnG3u/pU5NWfSEs9RNjpoBPsXD2jMeKKhL2c+Q==: If you have a Delivery vehicle, that is super helpful. A mini-van with the middle seats removed and a back seat that folds down is ideal to Deliver 4-5 Beds. Larger SUVs also work very well (Suburban, Expedition, Escalade, Navigator, etc). A full size pickup with tie down straps or a Cap can carry 4-5 Beds.

Youth groups, Churches and families have hosted Bedding drives (Twin XL sheet sets), pillow drives, Bibles drives, and blanket-tying parties. Youth groups, athletic teams and home Bible studies have decorated footboards.

St John’s Lutheran Church participated in Transformation Zone, a consortium of churches who learned about Jesus and served God together.

They loved the work and the impact this ministry had. They asked if Bed Brigade received calls from Columbus. Several times that summer, Jeff drove down to Circleville to learn more about their ministry. The Circleville Vineyard (Bed Brigade) met each Wednesday to Build and deliver beds.

Circleville Bed Brigade came to St Johns and helped us plant a new chapter. They even provided mattresses to help us get off to a good start.

So we Built more Beds. Support for this ministry grew with significant material donations from Hager Hinge Co. They donate roughly 2000 hinges each year. ODW - Dis Trans donated semi trailers to store mattresses. Dis-Trans will send a driver to local colleges and universities to pick up mattresses. With partners like this, and the generous support of St John’s Evangelical Lutheran Church, we are able to ensure that roughly $0.95 of every dollar donated goes to Build or Dress a Bed.

We want to come alongside families and let them know that they are not in this struggle on their own. We are here to help them because God sees them. He loves them and He cares for them. As Christians, we are called to help the least and the lost. As Jesus has shown love to us, we are to share that love with others. Bed Brigade is a perfect fit.

It is our hope that more people would know that God sees the situation that they are in, that God knows them, and God loves them. It is also our hope that more volunteers would delight in serving the Lord with us. * Correction: Greg Finzer has been involved with Bed Brigade since 2020, not since 2012.'

Greg Finzer has been serving consistently on Bed Brigade for 4 years building and delivering beds for people in need in the Columbus, Ohio area. Greg had been praying that God would allow him to use his software engineering skills for the Lord. He built our website in 2022. Greg's desire is that God would be glorified by the expansion of Bed Brigade to a national level. That people all over the nation would know that God knows them, God sees them, and God loves them. His short term plan is to increase deliveries to serve people in need. God is at work in Bed Brigade. We are thankful for all our partners and friends who are serving the Lord on Bed Brigade.

Today, there are people all over the Columbus area who are sleeping on the floor, on broken air mattresses, on a couch, or sharing a bed with siblings or parents. Some research indicates that between 3 - 5% of children in the US don't have a bed of their own to sleep on.

We have thought the bed building process through and made it easy for volunteers of all skill levels. If a volunteer has the desire to serve, they can successfully build a bed even if they've never used a cordless drill!

This is how you really get to show the Love of Christ, by delivering a bed to a child or family in need. We deliver beds on the second Saturday of the month. It takes about 2 1/2 hours to gather materials, pray, deliver and assemble beds. Besides giving the dignity of a bed, you will make a lasting impact for Jesus!

A mini-van with the middle seats removed and a back seat that folds down is ideal to deliver 4-5 Beds. Larger SUVs also work very well (Suburban, Expedition, Escalade, Navigator, etc).

We partnered with Bed Brigade out of Upper Arlington Lutheran Church. Since about 2014, Dale Cory has made sure that we always have mattresses to pair with our frames.

So we Built more Beds. Support for this ministry grew with significant material donations from Hager Hinge Co. They donate roughly 2000 hinges each year. ODW – Dis Trans donated semi trailers to store mattresses. Dis-Trans will send a driver to local colleges and universities to pick up mattresses. With partners like this, and the generous support of St John’s Evangelical Lutheran Church, we are able to ensure that roughly $0.95 of every dollar donated goes to Build or Dress a Bed.

On Saturday, May 18th, we had great deliveries with other friends serving. Lakita's children were so happy to receive beds that they make believed that they were swimming in their beds. Bed Brigade plants a lot of seeds that we may never see until we get to heaven. Each child gets an age appropriate Bible or Bible story. We also give a gospel tract to each requestor. God decided to show up in a big way. My son Samuel and I had lunch at Bob Evans. Our waitress Maria noticed our Bed Brigade hats. She proceeded to tell us that she received beds from Bed Brigade and because of that, she resumed attending church (The Naz). She is also taking her grandchildren to church. Her granddaughter loves to sing praise and worship songs in the bathroom because of the acoustics. Indeed Bed Brigade is having an eternal impact for the current generation and the next generation. Praise the Lord.
